                    After finishing high school at 16, I knew I wanted to build things. Having already dabbled in programming and enjoyed it, I dove into web development, excited about <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">creating fast and efficient solutions</span> that make a real impact.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    I gained <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">hands-on experience</span> during an internship, then worked there for 3 more months, helping with web solutions. 
                    This gave me a solid foundation, which helped me later on when I started building my own projects.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    During my studies, my team and I were <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">awarded for the best project</span>, which reinforced my passion for development.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    I've balanced freelancing with side projects while continuously learning.
                    Currently, I'm focused on <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">Otio</span>, the startup I co-founded with my friend Joan Paneque that simplifies tasting experiences with
                    an <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">online ticketing system</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I would like to end by bringing up my <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">favorite quote</span>:
                    "The secret to moving forward is to start" ~ Mark Twain.
