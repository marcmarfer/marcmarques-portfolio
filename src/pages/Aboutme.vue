                    After finishing high school at 16, I knew I wanted to build things. Having already dabbled in programming and enjoyed it, I dove into web development, excited about creating
                    <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">fast and efficient solutions that make a real impact.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    I gained <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">hands-on experience</span> during an internship, then worked there for 3 more months, helping with web solutions. 
                    This gave me a solid foundation, but I realized my passion was in <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">building my own projects</span>.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    During my studies, my team and I were <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">awarded for the best project</span>, which reinforced my passion for development.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    I've balanced <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">freelancing</span> with side projects while continuously learning.
                    Currently, I'm focused on <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">Otio</span>, the startup I co-founded with my friend Joan Paneque that simplifies tasting experiences with
                    an <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">online ticketing system</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm always looking for new challenges to create <span class="text-[#fbf060] px-1">impactful digital solutions</span>.
